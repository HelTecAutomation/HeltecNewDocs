HRI-3632 is a LoRaWAN conveter belonging to Sensor Hub for outdoor series,used to drive various third-party sensors. We have added 4 GPIO to it and equipped it with junction box to ensure the compatibility of its interfaces. Benefits from the IP66 protection provided by high-strength plastics, it can adapt to a variety of complex outdoor environments.
