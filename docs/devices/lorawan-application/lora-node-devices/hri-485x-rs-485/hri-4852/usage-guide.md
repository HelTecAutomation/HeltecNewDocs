3. Enter *192.168.4.1* through the browser. **Note that if you have just configured another device, don't just refresh '192.168.4.1', you should retype it.** If this triggers a BUG, click this link: [HRI-4852 configuration page fix](/docs/devices/open-source-devices/plug-play/hri-485x-rs-485/hri-4852/usage-guide).

4. When the configuration is completed, click `Submit` and press the `RST` key. The white LED is always on, indicating that the device enters the working mode.

## Data format
The following figure shows the data format of communication between HRI-4852 and HRI-4851:

![](img/08.png)

When the node sends *aa bb*, the server receives *HRI-4852 address + HRI-4851 address +aa bb*.

Similarly, if the server needs to issue *aa bb* instructions to the node, it needs to add the corresponding *HRI-4852 address + HRI-4851 address+ aa bb*.
