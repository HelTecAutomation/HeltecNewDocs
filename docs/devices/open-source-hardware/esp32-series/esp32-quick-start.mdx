# Heltec ESP32 Series Quick Start

*This article describes the installation of the Heltec ESP32 series development framework and library.*

## Summary
Heltec's Arduino-based ESP32 development environment consists of two parts:

- **Heltec ESP32 Development Framework**: Fully adapted from the official Espressif library, it includes board definitions, core functionalities, and examples for the ESP32 (such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and external drivers etc.).

- **Heltec Extended Example Library**: This library depends on the aforementioned ESP32 Development Framework**. It includes examples for LoRa/LoRaWAN, display demonstrations, GPS, sensors, and factory test programs for Heltec products etc..

:::warning
Framework v3.0.0 and Library v2.0.0 are updated together, Older frameworks and libraries are no longer applicable to the new ones.
:::

:::tip
You can also use the official [Espressif Arduino framework](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32) as a replacement for the Heltec ESP32 Development Framework. Just ensure that the corresponding version is compatible.

## Important to know

:::tip 
Regardless of which LoRaWAN NS, the parameters that need to be configured are similar. Ensuring that the relevant configurations of NS and Node are consistent is the key to ensuring successful LoRaWAN communication.
:::

**Device Type**

Generally, you will be asked to select a LoRa Gateway or LoRa Node.

**LoRaWAN Class**

`OTAA` or `ABP`, choose one of the while working, keep LoRa Node and NS select the same LoRaWAN Class.

*For development devices with source code, you may see something like this:*

![](img/connect_to_snapemu/03.png)



**Region**

LoRaWAN protocol agreement RF communication parameters. For technical details, please refer to [LoRaWAN™ 1.0.2 Regional Parameters](/docs/devices/general-docs/lorawan-instructions/lorawan_frequency_plans) and [LoRaWAN Frequency Plans and Regulations by Country/Region](/docs/devices/general-docs/lorawan-instructions/lorawan_frequency_plans_by_country) can make sense to you.

The region setting of `LoRa Node`, `LoRa Gateway`, `LoRaWAN NS` should be strictly the same.

*For development devices with source code, you may see something like this:*

![](img/connect_to_snapemu/05.png)

**OTAA Parameter**

For OTAA LoRaWAN Class, mainly include`DevEUI`, `AppEUI` (Also called `JoinEUI`), `AppKey`, the LoRa Node and NS should strictly keep the same.

![](img/connect_to_snapemu/07.png)



:::note
If you select ABP, you do not need to set OTAA parameters.
:::

**ABP Parameter**

For ABP LoRaWAN Class, mainly include `NetworkSecuritykey`, `ApplicationSecuritykey`, `DeviceAddress`, the LoRa Node and NS should strictly keep the same.

*For development devices with source code, you may see something like this:*
