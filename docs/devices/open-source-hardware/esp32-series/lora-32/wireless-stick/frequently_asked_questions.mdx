## Node to node communication

On the premise of no hardware problem, LoRa nodes can communicate with each other node-to-node. The key to success node-to-node communication need make sure the following 7 points the same:

1.  The same sending and listening frequency: `LoRa.setFrequency(frequency)`
2.  The same bandwidth: `LoRa.setSignalBandwidth(signalBandwidth)`
3.  The same coding rate: `LoRa.setCodingRate4(codingRateDenominator)`
4.  The same preamble length: `LoRa.setPreambleLength(preambleLength)`
5.  The same sync word: `LoRa.setSyncWord(syncWord)`
6.  The status of `LORA_IQ_INVERSION` is the same
7.  the same `SPREADING FACTOR`

Know more information about LoRa node-to-node communication, please refer to LoRa basic library APIs: `https://github.com/HelTecAutomation/Heltec_ESP32/blob/master/src/lora/API.md`
